### Firewall and Network Setup
```bash
# Windows Firewall (if needed)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Shiny App" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3838

# Check if port is available
netstat -an | findstr :3838
```

### Multi-User Support

   - Check if app is running with `0.0.0.0` host (not `127.0.0.1`)
   - Confirm devices are on same network subnet

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Monitor memory usage during high load
   - Check network bandwidth for large data transfers
   - Consider increasing R memory limits for large datasets

3. **Connection Timeouts**:
   - Increase Shiny session timeout if needed
   - Check router/network stability
   - Verify app server is responsive
