Test summary: full test suite run (local)
Date: 2025-12-23
Command: Rscript -e "testthat::test_dir('tests/testthat', reporter = 'summary')"

Overall status: ✅ All tests passed locally (0 failing tests)
Skipped tests: ✅ Multiple performance/CRAN-only tests skipped (expected)
Warnings: ℹ️ Informational warnings about packages built under a different R version; expected AI-linker messages when optional AI helper not present.

Notes:
- The vocabulary-based generator exported Excel files successfully to temporary locations.
- createBowtieNodesFixed() now validates its input and errors on invalid data as expected.
- Tests that previously emitted benign messages/warnings were updated to suppress expected noise (suppressWarnings()/suppressMessages()).

Important messages from the run (selected):
- "✅ Vocabulary-based bow-tie generation completed successfully!" (multiple occurrences)
- "ℹ️ AI vocabulary linker not found - basic functionality only" (expected when optional helper missing)
- Skipped list: many performance tests skipped on CRAN (test-guided-workflow-performance.R)

Full terminal output is saved in the project CI artifacts and in developer machine logs. If you want the complete raw output pasted here, I can add it to this file or a companion file.
